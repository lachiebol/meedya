1
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,190
饶了我...
Please don't kill--

2
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,327
求你饶了我
Please don't kill me.

3
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,873
我女儿病得很重
My daughter is very sick.

4
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,052
闭上双眼
Close your eyes.

5
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,263
要是想活命 就按我说的做
If you want to live, do as I say.

6
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,069
246号 淘汰
<i>Player 246, eliminated.</i>

7
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:21,539
《鱿鱼游戏 3》
SQUID GAME 3

8
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:28,379
第一集:钥匙与刀
EPISODE 1
KEYS AND KNIVES

9
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,020
抬走
Take it away.

10
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,242
现在怎么这么配合?
{\an8}Finally decide to be a good girl, did we?

11
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,494
不像你的作风
{\an8}This is new.

12
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,954
我想了想
{\an8}I gave it some thought.

13
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,580
反正他们都要死
{\an8}Since they're going to die anyway,

14
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,876
拿他们的器官救别人的命也不是坏事
{\an8}using their organs to save others
isn't such a bad idea.

15
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,963
这样想就对了
{\an8}Good thinking.

16
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,966
我很高兴你总算想通了
{\an8}I'm glad you finally came around.

17
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,636
我想看看
{\an8}Show me around.

18
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,430
看什么?
{\an8}Where?

19
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,765
看你们怎么干的
{\an8}The workroom.

20
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,393
为什么?
{\an8}What for?

21
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,608
我们现在
是一条绳上的蚂蚱了 不是吗?
{\an8}You and I are
in the same boat now, aren't we?

22
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,611
我们之间可不能有任何秘密 对吧?
{\an8}We don't want any secrets between us.

23
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,795
他死了?
{\an8}Is he dead?

24
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,631
还活着
{\an8}He's alive.

25
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,550
帮我把他抬到床上 快点
{\an8}Help me get him on the bed. Quickly.

26
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,552
好
{\an8}Okay.

27
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,014
来 抬到床上
{\an8}Here. To the bed.

28
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,437
我在船附近看不到他
He's nowhere around the boat.

29
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,357
他昨晚喝了多少?
How much did he drink last night?

30
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,942
不到喝醉的程度
Not enough to be wasted.

31
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,446
我数了数里面的空酒瓶 数量可不少
I counted the empty bottles inside.
There were quite a few.

32
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,744
他可能到外面来吐 然后掉进了海里
He could have come outside to puke
and fallen in.

33
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,621
昨天晚上这船摇得挺厉害
The boat was rocking a lot last night.

34
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,917
莫非我昨天半夜
听到的动静就是这个?
Maybe that's what I heard
in the middle of the night?

35
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,626
你听到什么了?
What did you hear?

36
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,589
我听到外面有人说话
然后叮呤咣啷的
I heard someone outside, some thrashing.

37
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,340
那是几点?
What time was it?

38
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,634
大概半夜三点 对吧?
It was around 3 a.m., wasn't it?

39
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,177
对 差不多
Yeah, around then.

40
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,847
于是我就出来看怎么回事
朴船长当时已经在了
So I went outside,
and Captain Park was already there.

41
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,267
我们就该把大家叫醒 一起找找他的
We should've woken everyone up
and gone looking for him.

42
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,935
我们先搜索一下周围吧
Let's search the area first.

43
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,103
可是 黄警官
But Detective Hwang.

44
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:35,607
这里的海流很急
他很可能一夜之间就被冲远了
The currents are strong here.
He probably drifted pretty far overnight.

45
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,277
要是他喝醉了掉进海里
那肯定没命了
If he got drunk and fell overboard,
there's no chance he's alive.

46
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,946
你还有闲工夫去找一具尸体吗?
Are you going to waste time
looking for a corpse?

47
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,283
不是说要在四天内找到那座岛吗?
You said you have to find the island
in three or four days.

48
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,414
我们去最近的港口
再找个无人机操作员
Let's go to the nearest port
and get another drone operator.

49
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,832
走吧
Let's get going.

50
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,522
我们先进行攻击吧
<i>Let's attack them first.</i>

51
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,691
那我们也不能互相残杀啊
<i>That doesn't mean</i>
<i>we should kill each other.</i>

52
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,693
这样就正中那些人下怀
<i>That's exactly what they want us to do.</i>

53
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,528
为了大义就要承受小的牺牲吗?
<i>A small sacrifice for the greater good?</i>

54
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:25,699
就算现在会有牺牲
这次也一定要让游戏结束
<i>Even if it takes a sacrifice,</i>
<i>we must put an end to this game now.</i>

55
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,326
我们一起战斗 一起回家吧
<i>Fight with us so we can go home together.</i>

56
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,078
愿意跟我们一起去的人
请走到前面来
<i>Anyone who wishes to join us,</i>
<i>please step forward.</i>

57
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,872
你为什么不跟零一来 要带我来?
<i>Why did you bring me instead of Young-il?</i>

58
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,166
毕竟你是我朋友
<i>Because you're my friend.</i>

59
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,378
成先生
Sir?

60
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,300
哎哟 成先生
Oh, gosh, sir?

61
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,718
你还活着
You're alive.

62
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,095
幸好你还活着
Thank God you're alive.

63
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,723
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

64
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,966
其他人呢?
What about the others?

65
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,019
正倍呢?
And Jung-bae?

66
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,574
好好看看你扮演英雄是什么下场
<i>Look closely at the consequences</i>
<i>of your little hero game.</i>

67
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,743
奇勋
<i>Gi-hun.</i>

68
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:22,232
昨晚共有35名玩家被淘汰
A total of 35 players
were eliminated last night,

69
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,777
目前还剩60名玩家
and 60 players remain in the game.

70
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,488
截至当前 累计奖金总额为396亿韩元
The prize money accumulated
up to this point is 39.6 billion won,

71
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,409
每位参与者分得6.6亿韩元
and each person's share
is 660 million won.

72
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:38,416
现进行全体投票
以决定是否继续游戏
You will now take a vote to decide
whether to continue the games or not.

73
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,255
为什么唯独没杀我?
Why did you keep me alive?

74
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,840
为什么没杀了我?
Why didn't you kill me?

75
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,135
说啊!为什么!
Answer me! Tell me why!

76
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,679
为什么让我活着?为什么?
Why did you let me live? Why?

77
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,557
开枪啊 你们这些王八蛋!
Shoot me, you bastards!

78
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,769
对 开枪啊!把我也杀了!
Yes, shoot me! Kill me too!

79
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,357
为什么让我活着?
Why did you let me live?

80
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,445
你想让我怎样?
What do you want from me?

81
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,492
为什么没杀了我?
Why didn't you kill me?

82
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,287
你赢了!
You won!

83
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,416
赶紧杀了我!
So go ahead and kill me!

84
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,045
你赢了!
<i>You won!</i>

85
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,801
求求你了 直接杀了我!
<i>I'm begging you, just kill me!</i>

86
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,523
我们暂时回到港口了
We're back at the port for now.

87
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,692
他们想另找无人机操作员
然后重返海域
The plan is to find another drone operator
and head back out.

88
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:51,613
在游戏结束前
绝不能让他们发现这座岛
Don't let them find the island
until the games are over.

89
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,740
明白
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

90
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,870
喂 黄警官!准备好出发就联系我
<i>Detective Hwang!</i>
<i>Give me a call when you're ready to go.</i>

91
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,374
-好
-小心脚下
-Okay.
-Watch your step.

92
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,714
如果事情出了状况我该怎么做?
What should I do if things go south?

93
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,430
都杀掉
Kill them all.

94
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,808
那个警察也别放过
Including the detective.

00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:28,317
现进行全体投票
以决定是否继续游戏
You will now vote again to decide
whether to continue the games or not.

96
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,113

The vote will again be held
in reverse order of your player numbers.

97
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,491
456号 请投票
Player 456, please cast your vote.

98
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,043
若数到三仍未表现出投票意图
If you don't show an intent to vote
by the count of three,

99
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,046
将被视为弃权
your vote will be considered
an abstention.

100
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,885
一、二、三
One, two, three.

101
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:03,101
456号玩家放弃投票 按弃权处理
Player 456 forfeited his vote,
so it will be counted as an abstention.

102
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,355
接下来 448号 请投票
Next, Player 448. Please cast your vote.

103
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,835
放心 没人会吃了你 安心投就是了
We're not going to hurt you,
so vote freely.

104
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,462
对 随便投
Yeah, do whatever you want.

105
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,008
安心投 没人在看
Don't mind us,
feel free to vote however you want.

106
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,371
我们一共伤亡八名管理员
以及27名士兵
The casualties have been identified,
eight managers and 27 soldiers.

107
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,956
用劳工替换阵亡的士兵
Replace the dead soldiers with workers

108
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,419
尽快修复受损的设施
and repair the damaged facility
as soon as possible.

109
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,671
贵宾们很快就要到了
The VIPs will be arriving soon.

110
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,756
是
Yes, sir.

111
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,340
你是在哪里学的射击?
Where did you learn to shoot?

112
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,218
我听说所有朝鲜女孩都要服兵役
I heard women serve in the military
in North Korea.

113
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,303
是不是?
Did you learn there?

114
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,180
对
Yes.

115
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,725
你为什么越境?
What made you cross the border?

116
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,185
在那边饿得受不了了吗?
Were you starving up there?

117
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,604
还是说
Or perhaps,

118
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,315
你惹上了大麻烦?
you got into serious trouble?

119
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,571
你说过我们现在是一条绳上的蚂蚱了
You said we were in the same boat now.

120
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,240
那不是要多多了解下彼此?
Shouldn't we get to know
each other better?

121
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,785
等这一切结束后 我们单独在外面见
Once this is over,
let's meet up, just you and me.

122
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,787
到时候我会告诉你
I'll tell you then.

123
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,874
我不想等那么久
I don't want to wait that long.

124
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,834
这里有个很适合约会的地方
There's a nice spot for a date here.

125
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,127
你想顺路去看看吗?
Do you want to stop by?

126
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,254
我的事说来话长
It's a long story.

127
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,839
先让我看看手术室吧
Let me see the workroom first.

128
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,924
好吧
All right.

129
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,469
我知道楼下有个地方
I know a little spot downstairs.

130
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,179
你也会喜欢的
You'll like it too.

131
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,187
根据你们自由民主的投票结果
In accordance with your free
and democratic vote,

132
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,273
我们明天将进行下一场游戏
we will proceed
with the next game tomorrow.

133
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,026
各位辛苦了
Thank you.

134
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,545
喂 456号
Hey, 456.

135
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,509
莫非这一切都在你的计划之中?
Tell me.
Was this all just part of your plan?

136
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,387
你策划了一场叛乱 引诱人们出去
You staged a rebellion to lure people out

137
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,641
然后一举将他们全部杀害 对吗?
and had them all
killed at once, didn't you?

138
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,726
可他还一副那个样子
But he was all like,

139
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,271
“杀了我!”
"Kill me!"

140
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,689
纯粹演戏作秀呢?
Was that just for show?

141
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,276
这个人可真恐怖
Man, he creeps me out.

142
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,820
没错
That's right.

143
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:44,198
那些人没有像杀其他人一样杀了他
而是把他带回了这里
Instead of killing him like the others,
they brought him back here.

144
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,449
肯定是有原因的
There's definitely something going on.

145
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,205
不管怎样 你让所有那些 带红牌的蠢货都送了命
Anyway, thanks to you taking out the reds
and getting them all killed,

146
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:56,210
多亏了你 奖金更多了 我们还以压倒性优势赢得了投票
the money went up,
and we won the vote by a landslide.

147
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,339
各位 让我们用热烈的掌声感谢他
Everyone, let's thank him
with a big round of applause.

148
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,592
感激不尽!
Thank you very much!

149
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,345
看来你从一开始就是我们的人
I see you were one of us all along.

150
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,724
你个蠢货
You fool.

151
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,518
我怎么跟你说的?
What did I tell you?

152
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,146
你并非自愿来到这里
You're not here of your own free will.

153
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,317
是那些在你头顶盘旋的复仇之魂
将你引至此处
Those vengeful souls hovering
over your head brought you here.

154
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,119
听到了吗?
Do you hear them?

155
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,040
你耳边正回响着朋友们的尖叫声
Your friends screaming right in your ears.

156
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:41,255
任凭你怎么捂住耳朵都无济于事
You can cover them all you want,
but it won't help.

157
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,383
尖叫声只会愈发刺耳
Those screams will only get louder.

158
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:49,889
直到你生命的最后一刻
这些尖叫声都将伴随着你
You will be hearing their screams
until the moment you die.

159
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,943
- 放开她!
- 放手吧!
-Let go of her!
-Let her go!

160
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,619
没事吧?
Are you all right, ma'am?

161
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,649
状况怎么样?
How does it look?

162
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,859
能拿到些好东西
We'll be able to get some good bits.

163
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,532
慢一点
Slowly.

164
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,535
一、二、三!
One, two, three!

165
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,834
没事 别担心
Relax. Don't worry.

166
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,088
11号现在是我们的人了
Number 011 is one of us now.

167
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,925
这家伙状况不错吧?
We brought you a good one, didn't we?

168
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,011
这是她送给我们的礼物
That's her gift to us.

169
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,431
你怎么带她过来了?
Why did you bring her here?

170
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,394
既然都是一条绳上的蚂蚱了
We're in the same boat now.

171
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,355
大家相互认识认识不是挺好的吗?
Isn't it nice to get to know each other?

172
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,608
在我们之前的那些人都是因为
The ones who were here before us
ended up in deep shit

173
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:30,154
彼此不信任、互相隐瞒才惨遭不幸
because they didn't trust each other
and kept secrets.

174
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,366
但我们信任彼此
所以不应该有任何秘密
But we trust each other,
so there shouldn't be any secrets.

175
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,453
所以我们说好在这里不戴面具
That's why we agreed
to keep our masks off in here.

176
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,040
不是吗?
Isn't that right?

177
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,683
你就是11号?
So you're Number 011?

178
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,478
你知道我们因为你损失了多少钱吗?
Do you realize how much fucking money
we've lost because of you?

179
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,438
没时间说别的了
There's no time for that.

180
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,691
我们得快点才能按时交货 开干吧
We have to move fast to make it on time.
Get to work.

181
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,737
过来
Come here.

182
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,115
我从头告诉你流程
I'll show you how it's done
from the start.

183
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,829
这就是你的礼物
That's your gift right there.

184
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,456
他还活着吧?
He's still alive, right?

185
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,875
对 只是昏迷状态
Yeah, just unconscious.

186
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,715
好 那我们现在
就拆开11号的礼物吧?
All right. Let's open up
Number 011's gift now, shall we?

187
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,721
- 怎么?
- 住手
-What is it?
-Stop.

188
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,056
怎...怎么了?
What… What the…

189
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,223
放下手术刀
Put the knife down.

190
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,892
-好
-喂 到底为什么?
-Okay.
-Hey, what the hell?

191
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,393
退后
Step back.

192
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,145
你这是反水了?
You psycho bitch!

193
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,230
你个疯婆子!
You psycho bitch!

194
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,715
想知道我为什么越境?
You wanna know why
I came down from the North?

195
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,512
我的指挥官跟你几乎一个德行
My commander was a lot like you,

196
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,765
于是我就爆了他的头
and I put a bullet in his head.

197
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,283
饶了我 我跟这些人不是一伙的
Don't kill me. I'm not with these guys.

198
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,578
我只是想挣钱才来
I just came here for the money.

199
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,498
救活这个人
Save this man.

200
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,876
他要是死了 你也没命
If he dies, you do too.

201
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,890
纯熙
Jun-hee.

202
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,021
红薯一直是你爱吃的
You like sweet potatoes.

203
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,096
成先生
Sir.

204
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,851
吃点东西吧 哪怕就吃一点
You should eat,
even if it's just a little.

205
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,526
我知道
Look, I know.

206
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:42,282
我知道你是想救大家的命
I know that
you were trying to save us all.

207
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,870
你只是想惩罚坏人 并结束这一切
You were trying to punish the bad guys
and put an end to all this.

208
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,290
对不起
I'm sorry.

209
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,671
我本该想办法
I should've found a way

210
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,341
把弹仓拿给你的
to bring back the magazines.

211
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,887
你没有什么好道歉的 贤珠
You have nothing
to apologize for, Hyun-ju.

212
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,348
都怪大虎
It's all Dae-ho's fault.

213
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,520
我看到了 我妈看到了 大家都看到了
I saw it, my mom saw it,
and everyone else saw it.

214
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,774
大虎来取弹仓 但就在要离开的时候
Dae-ho came to pick up the magazines,
but when he was about to leave,

215
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,277
他就瘫倒在了地上
he just sank to the floor.

216
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:24,573
而贤珠来取的时候 蒙面人闯了进来
When Hyun-ju came to get them,
the masked men barged in.

217
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,827
要不是我妈拦着
If my mom hadn't stopped her,

218
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,121
她也会没命的
she would've died too.

219
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,665
对吧 贤珠?
Isn't that right, Hyun-ju?

220
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,711
一味消沉并不能让任何人起死回生
This won't bring anyone back.

221
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,506
我们这些还活着的人
还要继续走下去 你说呢?
Those of us who are still alive
have to keep going, don't you think?

222
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,052
一定要吃饭啊 好吗?
Make sure you eat, okay?

223
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,723
你会口渴的 所以也要喝点水
Don't choke. Drink some water with it too.

224
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,314
哎哟 感觉他人都失了魂儿了
Gosh, he's completely out of it.

225
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,175
(11月4日 搜寻第四天)
NOVEMBER 4 - DAY 4 OF THE SEARCH

226
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,353
黄警官 睡了吗?
Hwang, are you asleep?

227
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,396
还没呢
No, not yet.

228
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,069
那既然没睡
Hey, since you're still up,

229
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,322
我们喝点儿酒 聊聊天儿?
can we talk for a bit over a drink?

230
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,991
好啊 请进吧
Sure, come in.

231
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,497
我就不喝了
No, I'm good.

232
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,875
哦 好吧
Oh, all right.

233
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,717
你想聊什么?请说吧
So, what did you want to talk about?

234
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,637
对
Right.

235
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,390
那个
Well,

236
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,975
是朴船长的事
it's about Captain Park.

237
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,270
你说他救了你
当时你差点淹死 对吧?
You said he saved you
when you almost drowned, right?

238
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:22,233
是的 我在一个岛上中枪后 掉进了海里
Yeah, I got shot on an island
and fell into the sea.

239
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,528
他把我救起并送到了医院
He rescued me and took me to the hospital.

240
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,197
那你还记得其他什么事吗?
Anything else you remember?

241
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:32,536
我醒来就在医院了
然后我妈告诉我是朴船长救了我
I just woke up at the hospital,
and my mom told me about Captain Park.

242
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,038
怎么了?
Why?

243
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,125
是这样
Well, the thing is,

244
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:43,796
我说我昨晚听到了些动静
于是出去查看 对吧?
I told you I heard some noises last night
and went outside, right?

245
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,965
是的 朴船长也听到了一些动静
Yes, Captain Park also heard some noises.

246
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,760
当时我没多想
I didn't think much of it at the time,

247
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:54,516
但他手里其实拿着什么东西
but it looked like
he was holding something in his hand.

248
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,350
什么东西?
What was it?

249
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,519
螺丝刀
A screwdriver.

250
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,019
谁在那里?
<i>Who's there?</i>

251
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,398
崔理事?
Choi, is that you?

252
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,151
是我 朴船长
It's me, Captain Park.

253
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,695
螺丝刀?
A screwdriver?

254
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,613
对
Yeah.

255
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,825
虽然很暗 但我绝对看到 他手里拿着一把螺丝刀
It was dark, but I definitely saw him
holding a screwdriver.

256
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,952
想想看 是不是很奇怪?
Think about it. Isn't that strange?

257
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,997
他为什么手里拿着那个东西?
Why was he holding that?

258
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,040
也许他在修理东西
Maybe he'd been doing some work.

259
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,627
可我记得他出来的时候
说自己正想睡觉
But I think he said
he was trying to sleep when he came out.

260
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,798
或者他为了安全起见抓了件武器
Or maybe he grabbed a weapon
just to be safe.

261
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,551
是吗?
You think so?

262
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,345
- 可是...
- 莫非
-But still, it's--
-Look.

263
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,726
你觉得无人机操作员的失踪
和他有关?
Do you think he has something to do
with the drone operator's disappearance?

264
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,856
我对这种事直觉很准
I have good instincts
for this kind of thing,

265
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,650
朴船长有点可疑...
and there's something fishy
about Captain Park--

266
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,445
他救了我的命
He saved my life,

267
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,947
而且这几年一直在帮我搜寻那座岛
and he's been helping me
search for the island for years.

268
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,741
即便现在也还是如此
He still is, even now.

269
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,326
我也知道
I know that.

270
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,330
我不是说他伤害了那位无人机操作员
I'm not saying
he did something to the drone operator.

271
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,498
我只是有种不好的...
I just have a bad--

272
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,294
你昨晚
也和那位无人机操作员喝酒了吧?
You had a drink with the drone operator
last night as well, didn't you?

273
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,549
是喝了 可喝得不多 就几杯
Well, yeah.
But not much, just a few drinks.

274
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,220
我们明天一早就出发
We're setting out early in the morning.

275
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,014
请回去睡觉吧
You should go get some sleep.

276
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,143
哦 好
Right, okay.

277
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,563
还有 从明天起
And starting tomorrow,

278
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,982
在船上不要再喝酒了
no more drinking on the boat.

279
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,112
好
All right.

280
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:35,218
第四场游戏即将开始
<i>The fourth game will begin momentarily.</i>

281
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,099
请按照工作人员的指示行动
<i>Please follow</i>
<i>the instructions from our staff.</i>

282
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,685
队长
Captain.

283
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,147
贵宾们到了
The VIPs have arrived.

284
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,047
你们现在看到的是
<i>You are witnessing the fate</i>

285
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:18,052
那些拒绝民主投票程序
<i>of those who refused</i>
<i>the democratic process of voting</i>

286
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:23,766
试图用暴力手段阻止游戏之人的命运
<i>and instead attempted to stop the game</i>
<i>using violent means.</i>

287
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:29,271
我们绝不容忍任何
<i>We will not tolerate</i>
<i>any irrational behavior</i>

288
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:34,610
破坏游戏规则的非理性行为
<i>which attempts to destroy</i>
<i>the fair rules of this game,</i>

289
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,989
此类行为
将按照我们的严格标准受到惩罚
<i>and such actions will be punished</i>
<i>in accordance with our strict standards.</i>

290
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:42,994
感谢大家的配合
<i>We thank you again for your cooperation.</i>

291
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,835
欢迎来到第四场游戏
<i>Welcome to your fourth game.</i>

292
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,548
本场游戏将分两队进行
<i>This game will be played in two teams.</i>

293
00:27:56,424 --> 00:28:01,012
开始游戏之前 各位要先进行分组
<i>Before we start the game,</i>
<i>you will divide into teams.</i>

294
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:08,103
请依次从面前的扭蛋机里抽取一个球
<i>Please take turns drawing a ball</i>
<i>from the gumball machine in front of you.</i>

295
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,988
子弹没有击中任何主要器官或动脉
The bullet didn't hit
any major organs or blood vessels.

296
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,990
我给他缝合了伤口 但是...
I stitched up his wound, but…

297
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,950
但是什么?
But?

298
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,619
他失血过多
He's lost too much blood.

299
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,163
他需要输血 但没有血源
He needs a transfusion,
but there's no blood.

300
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,168
用我的血吧
Use mine.

301
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,794
你是什么血型?
What's your blood type?

302
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,004
O型血
Type O.

303
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,507
应该没问题吧
That should work just fine.

304
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,220
没关系
我们都还不知道要玩什么游戏呢
It's okay. We don't even know
what game it is yet.

305
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,933
要是敢耍花招 你就死定了
Any funny business, and you're dead.

306
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:23,005
接下来要进行的游戏是捉迷藏
The game you will be playing is
Hide-and-seek.

307
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,339
捉迷藏?
Hide-and-seek?

308
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:29,386
蓝队必须在30分钟内找到出口并逃脱
The Blue Team must either find the exit
and escape within 30 minutes

309
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:33,640
或者在时间结束之前避开红队的追捕
or stay hidden from the Red Team
until the time is up.

310
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,100
那抓人者呢?
What about the taggers?

311
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,853
就像我们小时候那样
Just like when we played this as kids,

312
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,981
我们只需要抓到他们就行了?
all we need to do is find the ones hiding?

313
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:46,069
红队 即抓人者 必须在30分钟内
The Red Team, the taggers,
must find members of the Blue Team

314
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,656
找到蓝队的成员并杀掉他们
and kill them within 30 minutes.

315
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,578
杀掉他们?
Kill them?

316
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,746
没错
That is correct.

317
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:59,625
红队必须找到蓝队并杀掉他们
The Red Team must find
the Blue Team and kill them.

318
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,502
若未能杀死任何对方队员
就会被淘汰
If you fail to kill any opposing players,
you will be eliminated.

319
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,255
这些人要杀了我们?
That is correct.

320
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,256
是的
That is correct.

321
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,239
这是什么?
What is this?

322
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:36,286
你们得到的物品
是通往游戏场内各个房间的钥匙
You have been given keys
to doors in the arena.

323
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:40,624
此钥匙可以开门
You can use that key
to go through the doors,

324
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,628
但门被打开之后就不能再锁上
but once a door is unlocked,
it cannot be relocked.

325
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:49,049
所以他们可以
找个地方躲起来 用钥匙逃脱
So they can hide somewhere
and use their keys to escape.

326
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,634
那他们也太容易赢了!
They have it so much easier!

327
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,094
- 没错!
- 比我们容易多了
-That's right!
-So much easier.

328
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,348
我们还要杀了他们才行
On top of that,
we have to kill those people.

329
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,724
而且只能赤手空拳
And with our bare hands.

330
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,936
没错 这不公平
That's right. This isn't fair.

331
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,482
他们又不会自己送上门来求我们干掉
It's not like they will just roll over
and ask us to kill them.

332
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,360
难道指望我们赤手空拳杀人吗?
How do you expect us
to kill someone with our bare hands?

333
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:12,489
我们理解各位的顾虑
We understand your concerns.

334
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,703
所以红队也有一份小礼物
That's why we've prepared
a small gift for the Red Team as well.

335
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,999
请打开盒子查看
Please open the box and check.

336
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,630
谢谢
Thank you.

337
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:54,156
这把刀可用于攻击蓝队成员
The Red Team can use knives
to attack the Blue Team.

338
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:58,368
但抓人者之间禁止用刀互相攻击
However, members of the Red Team
are not allowed to attack each other.

339
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,788
好歹给我们配个护具吧?
Shouldn't you give us
a shield or something?

340
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:06,376
给他们小刀却让我们空手乱跑?
You give them knives
and expect us to just run around unarmed?

341
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,753
就是
He's right.

342
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,546
你们也得给我们装备啊
You've got to give us something too.

343
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:14,259
就是 我们就只有一把钥匙
这不公平!
Yes, all we have is a key.
That's not fair!

344
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,388
可你们能用钥匙开门逃跑啊
But you can use the key
to open a door and escape.

345
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,473
没错
That's right.

346
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,851
只要躲起来就行
对你们而言更简单!
Just hide somewhere.
It should be a piece of cake!

347
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,896
-对啊
-就是 对你们而言更简单
-Yeah.
-That's right. You have it easier.

348
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,773
正大哥
Brother.

349
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,485
这不正是你所擅长的吗?
That's what you're good at.

350
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,445
像老鼠一样东躲西藏
Hiding like a rat.

351
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,363
游戏开始前
Before we start the game,

352
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:39,118
你们还有最后一次改变命运的机会
we will give you one last chance
to change your fate.

353
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:44,372
若有人对自己所处的队伍不满
If any of you
are not happy with your role,

354
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,542
可在游戏开始前与他人交换队伍
you may switch roles
with someone on the opposing team

355
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,462
并互换背心及道具
before the game starts.

356
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,172
什么?能互换?
What? We can switch roles?

357
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,257
没错
That is correct.

358
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:59,347
双方同意即可交换道具和背心
You can swap your items and vests
upon mutual agreement.

359
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,849
但在游戏开始后
But once the game starts,

360
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:08,356
严禁脱下或交换背心
removing or trading your vests
will be strictly prohibited.

361
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,485
请慎重选择
Please make your choice carefully.

362
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,926
各位 这位是新的无人机操作员
Everyone, this is the new drone operator.

363
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,052
很高兴认识大家
Nice to meet you all.

364
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,596
找他过来不容易 要好好待他
It was hard to get him here,
so treat him well.

365
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,682
-是
-是
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

366
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,226
谢谢
Thank you.

367
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,938
好了 先穿上救生衣
All right, put on a life jacket first.

368
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,732
不能再出意外了
We don't want any more accidents.

369
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,441
听到了吧?
I guess you heard?

370
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,527
听到了
Oh, yes.

371
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,737
你在哪儿?赶紧来 要出发了
Where are you?
Hurry, we're about to leave.

372
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,366
黄警官 你们去吧 我就不跟着了
<i>Hwang, go ahead. I'm not coming with you.</i>

373
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,243
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

374
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,037
有件事我得去查清楚
<i>There's something I have to look into.</i>

375
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,416
你还在纠结那件事吗?
Are you still going on about this?

376
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:12,377
我的直觉一般都是对的
My gut feeling is usually right.

377
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:16,298
如果有所发现 我会打电话给你
在那之前小心行事 尤其注意朴船长
<i>Mr. Choi…</i>

378
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,299
崔理事...
<i>Mr. Choi…</i>

379
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,596
好了 我们出发吧
All right, let's get going now.

380
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,056
-走吧
-好
-Let's go.
-All right.

381
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,242
你究竟是怎么回事?突然就冒了出来
What on earth possessed you
to show up here out of the blue

382
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,871
而且一大早就给我打电话
and get me out so early in the morning?

383
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,916
我忙得不可开交 累得不行
I've been swamped with work,
and I'm exhausted.

384
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,462
老大死了
The boss is dead.

385
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:56,964
什么?
What?

386
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,342
他死了?怎么死的?
He's dead? What happened?

387
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,677
说来话长
It's a long story.

388
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:07,266
等等 那你为什么不打电话给我?
Wait, then why didn't you call me?

389
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,518
就因为我现在走正道了...
Just because
I'm on the straight and narrow now--

390
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,313
不是那样的 他...
It's not like that. He was…

391
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,109
你知道
“石头剪刀布 收回一个”游戏吧?
You know
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Minus One, right?

392
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:22,031
-知道
-我们俩玩了这个游戏 然后...
-Yeah.
-He and I played it, and…

393
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,911
对 他只需要收回另一个...
Yeah. He just needed to minus the other…

394
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,707
算了
Never mind.

395
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,709
我们还是去喝点解酒汤吧
Let's just go have some hangover soup.

396
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,379
把话说完啊 然后呢?
Finish your story. So what happened?

397
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,174
开车 我路上跟你说
Start the car. I'll tell you on the way.

398
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,051
真是搞不懂你
I don't get you at all.

399
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,135
(武津室内设计)
How does someone die
by playing Rock, Paper, Scissors?

400
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:47,389
玩剪刀石头布怎么会死人呢?
How does someone die
by playing Rock, Paper, Scissors?

401
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,351
你们没人能活着离开这里
None of you can get out of here alive.

402
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,936
那我该...
Then, what should I…

403
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,648
唯有我 龙宫仙女
Only I, shaman of the sea,

404
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,900
能指引你们生路
can guide you to the path of life.

405
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,902
-我们相信你 女士
-我们会跟随你
-We believe in you, ma'am.
-We'll follow you.

406
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,196
天地神明啊...
Dear gods of heaven and earth…

407
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:08,452
从这里便能洞见彼方所有路径
I can see all the paths
in that place from here.

408
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,205
并非用双眼所窥!
It is not with my eyes I see!

409
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:15,084
天地神明
The gods of heaven and earth

410
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,921
正牵着我的手引路!
are leading me by the hand!

411
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,425
追随我者 可得永生
Those who follow me
shall continue to live.

412
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,844
敏秀
Min-su.

413
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,932
- 阻我路者 必死无疑!
- 你杀过人吗?
-Anyone who gets in my way shall die!
-Have you ever killed anyone?

414
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,979
喂 没时间了 如果你下不去手就换队伍
Hey, there's no time.
If you can't do it, switch teams.

415
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,315
你倒是挺会藏的
You're damn good at hiding.

416
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,319
敏秀 我昨晚到处找你
Min-su.
I looked everywhere for you last night,

417
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,154
可就是找不到
but I couldn't find you.

418
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,906
你藏在哪里了?
Where were you hiding?

419
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,660
你是害怕我吗?
Were you that scared of me?

420
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,541
你藏得很好 干得好
It's good that you hid yourself.
Well done.

421
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:00,003
那个臭婊子还以为自己是神奇女侠
That fucking bitch thought
she was Wonder Woman or something.

422
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:04,133
那婊子把我当傻子耍 她居然...
That goddamn bitch treated me
like a fucking idiot, and she…

423
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:12,975
你看到了吗?
Did you see it?

424
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,103
妈的 你看到了是不是?
Damn. You saw it, didn't you?

425
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:20,315
可你却像只死老鼠一样缩着
袖手旁观?
But you stayed hidden like a fucking rat
and just watched?

426
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,903
你应该帮她的 那个婊子喜欢你呢
You should've helped her.
That fucking bitch liked you.

427
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,657
敏秀
Min-su.

428
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,869
我喜欢你现在的眼神
I like that look in your eyes right now.

429
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,916
开玩的时候就保持这样 放开去干
Keep that look when you go in there,
and just go for it.

430
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,380
萨诺斯那个混蛋已经死了
Thanos, that fucking bastard, is dead.

431
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,217
咱们这个小团体的其他人都死了
只剩你我了
So is everyone else in our group.
It's just you and me now.

432
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,261
如果你也死了 我会很孤单的
I'll be really lonely if you die too.

433
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,476
所以这次做个男人吧 敏秀 好吗?
So be a man this time, Min-su. Okay?

434
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,271
你可以的 兄弟 敏秀
You can do it, my bro, Min-su.

435
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,816
敏秀
Min-su.

436
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,111
回头见 敏秀
See you again, Min-su.

437
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,738
纯熙 和我交换
Jun-hee. Switch with me.

438
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,199
你拿上钥匙
You take the key.

439
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,368
这样我们才都能活
That's how we'll both survive.

440
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,245
管好你自己吧
Mind your own business.

441
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,705
我会照顾好自己的
I'll take care of myself.

442
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,041
那怎么行?
How do I do that?

443
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,502
我知道你拿了刀也成不了事
I know you won't be able
to do anything with the knife.

444
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,295
少装出一副很了解我的样子
Don't act like you know
everything about me.

445
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,048
或许我不了解 但有件事我很清楚...
Maybe I don't, but I do know one thing.

446
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,010
你根本下不去手杀人
You can't kill anyone.

447
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,308
把刀给我
Give me the knife.

448
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:41,772
我会尽快干掉别人 然后就去找你
I'll take someone out as quickly as I can,
and then come find you.

449
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:47,027
我会保护你和孩子的 纯熙
I will protect you and the baby, Jun-hee.

450
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,907
你觉得杀人很容易?
Is it easy for you to kill someone?

451
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,036
只要
I would

452
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,748
能带着你和钱离开这里
杀光所有人我也愿意
kill everyone here if it meant
leaving here with you and the money.

453
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,043
为了保护我的孩子
我同样什么都做得出来
To protect my baby, I'd do anything too.

454
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,298
那...
Then…

455
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,430
你把我杀了吧
you kill me.

456
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:19,226
游戏一开始 我就去找你
I'll come find you once the game begins.

457
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,854
用刀捅我 然后出去
Stab me with that knife and get out.

458
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,320
那样你和孩子就能活下来
Then you and the baby can live.

459
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:37,995
把刀给我
Give me the knife.

460
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,877
我会跟别人换队
I'll switch teams
with someone else instead.

461
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,504
我们可以待在一起...
We can stay together and--

462
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,047
妈
Mom,

463
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,925
你膝盖不好
you have bad knees.

464
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,802
一进去
Once we go in there,

465
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:59,390
那些人就会举着刀扑过来
those people will come at us
with their knives.

466
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:02,102
如果我们待在一起
If we go around hand in hand,

467
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,897
两个都得死
we'll both die.

468
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,568
不 你下不去手的
No, you won't be able to do it.

469
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,572
你怎么可能用这个杀人?
How could you kill a person with this?

470
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:19,619
小时候打架 你就总是
Even as a kid, you always let other kids

471
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,332
像个傻子一样任人揍
beat you up like a fool
whenever you got into a fight.

472
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:27,335
你从没伤害过任何人 一次都没有
You've never hurt anyone, not even once.

473
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,629
那你呢?
What about you?

474
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,965
你能用刀去杀人吗?
Can you go and kill someone with that?

475
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,302
爸一直打你 可你从未还过手
Dad beat you all the time,
but you couldn't even fight back.

476
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,852
我来
I'll do it.

477
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,190
我尽力
I'll… try.

478
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,327
谢谢
Nice.

479
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,495
漂亮
Nice.

480
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,796
十分感谢
Thanks a bunch.

481
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:17,303
那个 你愿意跟我换...
Excuse me, would you like to switch with…

482
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,356
听我说
Listen to me.

483
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,816
如果你跟我换队
If you switch teams with me,

484
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:35,321
我就跟你待在一起
保护你到最后 好吗?
I'll stay with you
and protect you until the end, okay?

485
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,532
但那样你也得杀人才行
But you'd have to kill someone too.

486
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,993
你能不能...
Will you just…

487
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,331
你就别管了
Just leave that to me.

488
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,958
我还是会跟你待在一起的
I can still stay with you.

489
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,754
请相信我 我会信守诺言的
Please trust me. I'll keep my promise.

490
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,714
好吗?
Okay?

491
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
好吗?
Okay?

492
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,286
妈的
Fuck.

493
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,042
怎么?你对我有意见?
What? What's your problem with me?

494
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,253
你为什么一直这么看着我?
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

495
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:38,174
你想把一切怪到我头上?
Want to blame me for everything?

496
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,635
我犯了什么滔天大错?
What did I do so wrong?

497
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,055
我们赢不了的
We wouldn't have won.

498
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,392
无论如何我们也赢不了的
We wouldn't have won anyway.

499
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,229
妈的 不要再这样看我!
Fuck, stop looking at me like that!

500
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,606
那不是我的错!
It's not my fault!

501
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:58,277
如果我们当时和选圈的那些混蛋打
If we had fought
the other damn side instead,

502
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,613
或许我们能赢
we could have won.

503
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,741
我们兴许能赢下战斗
然后赢得投票!
We could have won the fight
and then the vote!

504
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,868
都怪你
It's your fault.

505
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,579
他们都是因为
你那荒唐的计划才死的!
They all died
because of your ridiculous plan!

506
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,667
是你!是你杀了他们!
It's you!
You're the one who fucking killed them!

507
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,472
游戏即将开始
<i>The game will begin momentarily.</i>

508
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:32,187
蓝队 请准备进入游戏场
<i>Blue Team,</i>
<i>please get ready to enter the arena.</i>

509
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,106
重复一遍
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

510
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:38,694
游戏即将开始
<i>The game will begin momentarily.</i>

511
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,035
崔理事呢 他怎么没来?
What happened to Choi? He didn't show.

512
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,872
我之前跟他通了电话
I talked to him on the phone earlier.

513
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,624
他家里突然有急事
An urgent family matter came up.

514
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,002
这么突然?
All of a sudden?

515
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,378
是啊
I know.

516
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,839
也许他怕了
Maybe he chickened out.

517
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,050
他装得很强硬 还大声嚷嚷
People who act all tough and loud like him

518
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,928
其实最懦弱
are actually the biggest wimps.

519
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,223
这样也好
It's for the best.

520
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,435
他不过是个蹭吃蹭喝的酒鬼
He's just a booze-chugging freeloader.

521
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,925
妈 好好藏起来
Mom, stay well hidden.

522
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,219
我抓紧了事 然后就去找你
I'll get it over with
and then come find you.

523
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,014
我会找到你 然后保护你
I'll find you and protect you.

524
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,432
容植
Yong-sik.

525
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:56,312
每次你爸喝醉了 就总威胁要杀了我
Whenever your dad got drunk,
he always threatened to kill me.

526
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,899
但谁先死了呢?
But who kicked the bucket first?

527
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,109
是爸
Dad.

528
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,446
所以你真以为我会死在这里?
So do you really think
I'm gonna die in here?

529
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:11,036
另外 我还有个武器以备不时之需
Besides, I also have a weapon
for emergencies.

530
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,748
所以不必担心我
So don't worry about me.

531
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,292
做好你自己的事
Focus on yourself.

532
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:25,050
不惜一切代价活下去
然后我们一起离开这里 好吗?
Do whatever it takes to survive,
and we'll get out of here together, okay?

533
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,775
不要失言
Keep your word.

534
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,708
我一定会去找你的
I promise I'll find you.

535
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,345
靠...
Shit…

536
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:38,415
抓人者两分钟后进入
<i>The taggers will enter in two minutes.</i>

537
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,917
大家听好
Listen up, people.

538
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:44,587
以免被发现 大家散开去找出口
Instead of hiding,
